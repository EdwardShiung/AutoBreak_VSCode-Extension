# Delete Function


1. This is a VSCode extension designed to quickly delete functions. Currently, this feature is limited to general functions, and support for arrow functions, function expressions, etc., has not yet been added.

2. For redevelopment, please follow these steps:
    - git clone repository
    - npm i

3. Within the project hierarchy:
    - src
        - extension.ts ---> Project main entry file
    - test
        - vitest (npx vitest run)
